Purpose
Model B is a predictive analytics system that forecasts future hotspots and risk periods for ocean hazards along the coast using machine learning, before any direct report comes in—empowering advance warning and disaster mitigation.

Detailed Steps and Functionality
1. Data Aggregation
A. Historical Hazard Events
Collects past event records:

Floods, tsunamis, storm surges, high wave events.

With data fields: date, location, type, severity, impact.

B. Real-Time Sensor/Environmental Data
Gathers data from:

Weather stations (rainfall, wind speed, pressure).

Ocean sensors/buoys (sea level, temperature, wave height, tides).

Crowd report volume and social spike data (from Model A).

C. Geospatial and Contextual Data
Coastal vulnerability indices.

Geographical features (coast type, urban/rural, river inlets, etc.).

Land use/population density for impact assessment.

2. Feature Engineering
Creates input features for models:

Temporal: season, time of year/day, event sequence.

Spatial: location coordinates, district, region type.

Environmental: current and forecast sensor values.

Social signals: are people in the area posting more about hazards?

Can include historic “lagged” events (e.g., what happened here last month?).

3. Predictive Modeling
A. Machine Learning Models
Tests and deploys best-fit algorithms:

Time series models (LSTM, ARIMA, Prophet) for incident forecasting.

Classification/regression (Random Forest, XGBoost) to score risk by location/time.

Spatial clustering for new/emerging hotspots.

B. Model Training and Validation
Trained/tested on Indian hazard history.

Regularly updated as new data/events come in.

4. Output Generation
Risk scores: Predicts risk for every zone (high/medium/low) for upcoming hours or days.

Hotspot mapping: Visualizes future risk on maps for decision-makers.

Predictive alerts: Notifies when and where risk will peak—even before any report or actual incident.

C. Feedback/Continual Learning Integration
Human experts/analysts can mark predictions as correct, missed, or inaccurate.

This “real-world” feedback is used to periodically retrain and recalibrate the models for higher prediction accuracy.

Summary in Plain English
Model B forecasts where and when the next coastal hazard is most likely to happen, before anyone knows it’s coming—so authorities get precious extra time to prepare, warn, and protect communities.

How They Fit Together (Team/Project Level)
Model A: “What’s happening right now and where?” (Live detection, filtering, human feedback, escalation)

Model B: “What is likely to happen next, and where?” (Prediction, hotspot mapping, prepares resources in advance)

Combined output: Real-time dashboard, automated alerts, trend and forecast maps, analyst review interface, and a continually improving AI engine powered by real data and feedback.

Integration: Both are exposed as APIs/services, called by backend (Node.js), data visualized in React frontend, persistence by MongoDB, and analyst/operator feedback loop.
