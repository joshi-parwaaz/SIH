# Model A: Multilingual Hazard Detection & Extraction System

## Purpose
Model A is designed to process and analyze all incoming hazard-related data (social media, government alerts, and user/citizen reports) in real time and in any language, extracting actionable insights for rapid disaster response and situational awareness.

## Detailed Steps and Functionality

### 1. Multilingual Input Handling
**Accepts data from:**
- Social media (X/Twitter, Facebook, YouTube comments): public hazard reports, warnings, viral posts
- Official alert feeds (INCOIS, state governments, meteorological departments)
- Crowdsourced user reports (from the custom app/platform, web input)

**Can process:**
- Any major Indian language
- English, code-mixed Hindi-English, Romanized script, and regional dialects

### 2. Core AI Pipeline

#### A. Preprocessing
- **Language Detection:** Determines input language for correct NLP model routing
- **Text Normalization:** Handles code-mixing, spelling errors, emojis, etc.

#### B. Multilingual NLP/LLM Analysis
Uses state-of-the-art multilingual LLMs (like Llama-3, Mixtral, GPT-4) and pretrained transformer models (xlm-roberta, indic-bert).

**Performs:**
- Relevance classification: Is this input about an ocean hazard? (binary/multiclass classifier)
- Event type extraction: What type? (e.g., flood, tsunami, high waves, storm surge)
- Severity and urgency scoring: Extracts how severe/urgent each event is, based on text cues and sentiment
- Sentiment/emotion detection: Finds panic, anxiety, or calm/relief in report text
- Misinformation/fake alert flagging: Detects possible rumors or unverified info

#### C. Geolocation/NER Extraction
Named Entity Recognition (NER) models extract:
- Place names, landmarks, and context clues, even without GPS
- Tries to resolve “missing locations” by fuzzy matching (e.g., Rameshwaram beach, near the lighthouse) to mapped regions

#### D. Anomaly/Spike Detection
- Monitors the frequency and type of incoming reports by area and time
- If there's a sudden surge in a certain region/event type, it immediately flags an anomaly for rapid response teams

#### E. Operator/Analyst Feedback Integration
- Provides a way for human analysts to review and “correct” model outputs (e.g., misclassified events, missed hazard, false alarms)
- All corrections are logged, feeding back into the model for periodic retraining and continual improvement

### 3. Outputs
- **Structured hazard data:** For every input, outputs:
  - Hazard type, severity, urgency, sentiment, possible misinformation, geolocation, timestamp, source
- **Anomaly/spike alerts:** For rapid escalation to authorities
- **Visualizations:** Data displayed on map-based dashboards, highlighting real-time events and spikes

## Summary in Plain English
Model A reads, understands, and organizes all hazard reports or alerts—no matter the language or format—so disaster managers get real-time, clear, and actionable intelligence, with analytics that learn and improve with feedback.
